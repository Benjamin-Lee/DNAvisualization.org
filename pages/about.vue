        Raw DNA sequences, which consist of long strings of letters, are hard
        for humans to make sense of at a glance. However, there is significant
        biological meaning contained within them. To reveal this meaning,

          >a number of methods</a
        >
        have been proposed to convert raw DNA sequences into two-dimensional
        visualizations. This website allows you to try several of these methods
        out on your data with a high-performance parallel-computing backend
        enabling genome-scale visualization.
