  abstract = {We present a novel 2-D graphical representation for DNA sequences which has an important advantage over the existing graphical representations of DNA in being very compact. It is based on: (1) use of binary labels for the four nucleic acid bases, and (2) use of the \^Oworm\~O curve as template on which binary codes are placed. The approach is illustrated on DNA sequences of the first exon of human b-globin and gorilla b-globin.},

Based on 2-D graphical representation of DNA sequences, Raychaudhury and Nandy introduced the first-order moments of the x and y coordinates and the radius of the plot of a DNA sequence for indexing scheme and similarity measures of DNA sequences. In this Letter, based on Guo\~Os novel 2-D graphical representation of DNA sequences of low degeneracy, we introduce the improved first-order moments of the x and y coordinates and the radius of DNA sequences, and the distance of two DNA sequences. The new descriptors of DNA sequences give a good numerical characterization of DNA sequences, which have lower degeneracy.},

  abstract = {Graphical representation of DNA sequence provides a simple way of viewing, sorting and comparing various gene structures. A new two-dimensional graphical representation method using a twoquadrant Cartesian coordinates system has been derived for mathematical denotation of DNA sequence. The two-dimensional graphic representation resolves sequences' degeneracy and is mathematically proven to eliminate circuit formation. Given x-projection and y-projection of any point on the graphical representation, the number of A, G, C and T from the beginning of the sequence to that point could be found. Compared with previous methods, this graphical representation is more inline with the conventional recognition of linear sequences by molecular biologists, and also provides a metaphor in two dimensions for local and global DNA sequence comparison.},

Then, we give a novel 2D graphical representation for DNA sequences, which can transform a DNA sequence into a plot set to facilitate quantitative comparisons of DNA sequences. Thereafter, associating with a newly designed measure of similarity, we introduce a novel approach to make similarities/dissimilarities analysis of DNA sequences. Finally, the applications in similarities/dissimilarities analysis of the complete coding sequences of $\beta$-globin genes of 11 species illustrate the utilities of our newly proposed method.},

It permits the representation and investigation of patterns in sequences, visually revealing previously unknown structures. Based on a technique from chaotic dynamics, the method produces a picture of a gene sequence which displays both local and global patterns. The pictures have a complex structure which varies depending on the sequence. The method is termed Chaos Game Representation (CGR). CGR raises a new set of questions about the structure of DNA sequences, and is a new tool for investigating gene structure.},
