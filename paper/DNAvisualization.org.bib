  abstract = {We present a novel 2-D graphical representation for DNA sequences which has an important advantage over the existing graphical representations of DNA in being very compact. It is based on: (1) use of binary labels for the four nucleic acid bases, and (2) use of the \^Oworm\~O curve as template on which binary codes are placed. The approach is illustrated on DNA sequences of the first exon of human b-globin and gorilla b-globin.},

In this Letter, based on Guo\~Os novel 2-D graphical representation of DNA sequences of low degeneracy, we introduce the improved first-order moments of the x and y coordinates and the radius of DNA sequences, and the distance of two DNA sequences. The new descriptors of DNA sequences give a good numerical characterization of DNA sequences, which have lower degeneracy.},

  abstract = {Graphical representation of DNA sequence provides a simple way of viewing, sorting and comparing various gene structures. A new two-dimensional graphical representation method using a twoquadrant Cartesian coordinates system has been derived for mathematical denotation of DNA sequence. The two-dimensional graphic representation resolves sequences' degeneracy and is mathematically proven to eliminate circuit formation. Given x-projection and y-projection of any point on the graphical representation, the number of A, G, C and T from the beginning of the sequence to that point could be found. Compared with previous methods, this graphical representation is more inline with the conventional recognition of linear sequences by molecular biologists, and also provides a metaphor in two dimensions for local and global DNA sequence comparison.},

Thereafter, associating with a newly designed measure of similarity, we introduce a novel approach to make similarities/dissimilarities analysis of DNA sequences. Finally, the applications in similarities/dissimilarities analysis of the complete coding sequences of $\beta$-globin genes of 11 species illustrate the utilities of our newly proposed method.},

  title = {{{GraphDNA}}: A {{Java}} Program for Graphical Display of {{DNA}} Composition Analyses},
  abstract = {Background: Under conditions of no strand bias the number of Gs is equal to that of Cs for each DNA strand; similarly, the total number of Ts is equal to that of As. However, within each strand there are considerable local deviations from the A = T and G = C equality. These asymmetries in nucleotide composition have been extensively analyzed in prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes and related to chromosome organization, transcription orientation and other processes in certain organisms. To carry out analysis of intra-strand nucleotide distribution several graphical methods have been developed.
Results: GraphDNA is a new Java application that provides a simple, user-friendly interface for the visualization of DNA nucleotide composition. The program accepts GenBank, EMBL and FASTA files as an input, and it displays multiple DNA nucleotide composition graphs (skews and walks) in a single window to allow direct comparisons between the sequences. We illustrate the use of DNA skews for characterization of poxvirus and coronavirus genomes.
Conclusion: GraphDNA is a platform-independent, Open Source, tool for the analysis of nucleotide trends in DNA sequences. Multiple sequence formats can be read and multiple sequences may be plotted in a single results window.},

In this paper, we propose a graphical representation of DNA sequences based on nucleotide ring structure. In the proposed representation, we convert DNA sequences into 16 dinucleotides on the surface of the hexagon so that it can preserve nucleotide's chemical property and positional information. Our approach can provide capability of efficient similarity comparison between DNA sequences and also high comparison accuracy. Furthermore, our approach satisfies uniqueness and no degeneracy of DNA sequences. In the experimental study, we use phylogeny analysis for evolutionary relationship among different species. Extensive performance study shows that the proposed method can give better performance than existing methods in comparison with the degree of similarity.},

  abstract = {Background: Molecular biology data exist on diverse scales, from the level of molecules to -omics. At the same time, the data at each scale can be categorised into multiple layers, such as the genome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, and biochemical pathways. Due to the highly multi-layer and multi-dimensional nature of biological information, software interfaces for database browsing should provide an intuitive interface that allows for rapid migration across different views and scales. The Zoomable User Interface (ZUI) and tabbed browsing have proven successful for this purpose in other areas, especially to navigate the vast information in the World Wide Web.
Results: This paper presents Genome Projector, a Web-based gateway for genomics information with a zoomable user interface using Google Maps API, equipped with four seamlessly accessible and searchable views: a circular genome map, a traditional genome map, a biochemical pathways map, and a DNA walk map. The Web application for 320 bacterial genomes is available at http:// www.g-language.org/GenomeProjector/. All data and software including the source code, documentations, and development API are freely available under the GNU General Public License. Zoomable maps can be easily created from any image file using the development API, and an online data mapping service for Genome Projector is also available at our Web site.
Conclusion: Genome Projector is an intuitive Web application for browsing genomics information, implemented with a zoomable user interface and tabbed browsing utilising Google Maps API and Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) technology.},
